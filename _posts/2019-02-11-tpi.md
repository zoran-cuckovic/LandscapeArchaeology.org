Topographic position index (TPI) is a method of terrain classification where the altitude of each data point is evaluated against its neighbours. If a point is higher than its surroundings, the index will be positive, otherwise it will be negative (e.g. for valley bottoms). Weiss (2001) has proposed a complex terrain classification on the basis of the amount of difference (hilltop, incised valley, shallow valley etc.).

*Terrain position index (concavities are in blue and convexities in red). These are animal tracks and some human paths on a Lidar derived DEM.* 

Technically, TPI functions as simple average filter or, more precisely, a kernel filter where each cell is assigned the value of its neighbourhood ([see on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))). The neighbourhood size and shape is typically fixed, it does not vary from cell to cell. This average value is then subtracted from the actual height value to evaluate the difference (negative values will, then, represent concave surfaces and positive ones convexities).  

TPI is today included in most of GIS software, such as QGIS, GRASS, ArcGis or Saga – so why should we bother? The answer is in the simplicity of the method: it can easily be customised and experimented with in order to obtain that original result which will distinguish your work form other push-button solutions. We can play with window size or specific weight factors, for instance when window periphery should count less than the window centre. Such freedom can be very useful when fine tuning Lidar visualisations, for example. 

In what follows, I will only provide the basic architecture for a TPI filter, based on the [sliding window routine developed for numpy](https://landscapearchaeology.org/2018/numpy-loops/). Window size and weights can be fine-tuned in relation to specific problems (see below). To test the script you can use QGIS (open the Python console and just copy-paste the code) or run in pure Python.

```

## Sliding window
The script is using both, window geometry (square, circle etc.) and window weights which are applied to individual values. Geometry is modelled by setting unwanted window parts to zero, while weights should be non-zero values. Note that zero values are simply skipped as if non-existent, which will not happen with, say, weight = 0.00001. 

It is not difficult to create windows on the fly: 
```
r = 5 #radius in pixels
win = np.ones((2*r +1, 2*r +1)) #square window, all values are 1
win[r, r] = 0  #skipping the central cell
```
For Gaussian window weights: see [numpy documentation]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.multivariate_normal.html).

However, I find more useful (and intuitive) to hard-code window definitions. This is very handy when comparing results on different datasets – there can be no error when the window is specified cell by cell. We can also keep a diary with window definitions that work best, like:
-	Fine 3x3 filter : 
  
                      [0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0],
                      [0, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0],
                      [0.5, 1, 0, 1, 0.5],
                      [0, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0],
                      [0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0] 
                  
-	Aggressive 3x3 filter (best on such and such DEMs…)

                      [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
                      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                      [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
                      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                      [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
                     
-	A totally skewed filter for detecting linear patterns:

                      [0, 0, 0, 0.5, 1],
                      [0, 0, 0.5, 1, 0.5],
                      [0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 0],
                      [0.5, 1, 0.5, 0, 0],
                      [1, 0.5, 0, 0, 0 ]
              
Danger in this approach is in the assumption that **the central data point is in the geometric centre of the kernel window**. For this to be true, dimensions of the window should be in odd numbers. For instance, in 3x3 window, the central pixel is at (1,1) position. In a 4x4 window, the centre falls between cells, which doesn’t work! Therefore, be sure to count your pixels. 

Happy mapping !
